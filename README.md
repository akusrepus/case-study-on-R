## Insights

- **Daily "Steps" Reminders**: The distribution of total steps suggests that a significant portion of users are not walking enough throughout the day. This may indicate sedentary lifestyles, which can impact overall health.

- **Sleep Tracking & Improvement**: The sleep duration data reveals variability in sleep patterns, with some users either sleeping too little or having inefficient sleep.

- **Bellabeat should**:
- âœ“ Introduce daily step reminders via app notifications, smart wearable vibrations, or personalized goal-setting features to encourage users to stay active.
- âœ“ Enhance its sleep tracking technology, potentially integrating sleep efficiency scores or bedtime reminders to help users optimize their rest.
